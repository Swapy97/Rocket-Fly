# Rocket Fly

# Discontinued!

**Why is it dicontinued?**

Because Rocket Fly is written in Processing and we would like to make it a multiplayer game.
There are several Websocket implementations but we are not going for them.

We are currently working on a rewrite of Rocket Fly for the web which is written in JavaScript. 
It will be multiplayer-based with a NodeJS server on the backend and P5.js on the frontend.
Both using Socket.IO to connect to each other.



**What is Rocket Fly?**

It's simple. It's just a simple space game where you can fly around with a rocket.
You can shoot comets and destroy them. If you fly into one of the comets your lost the game!
You can gain a score by shooting the comets (each comet increases the score by one!)

**What is it written in?**

Rocket Fly is written in Processing. 
Processing is a Java-based Programming Language which focuses on Graphics.
