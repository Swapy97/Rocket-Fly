# Discontinued!

**Why is it dicontinued?**

Rocket Fly is built on Processing without the use of any extra libraries.
Therefore it's a hassle to create a code structure which is both scalable and simple to understand.
This project was a personal project for getting into game development.
I appreciated it but it all comes to an end eventually.
